# DataScience-Problems
It contains fundamental data science related projects.
I borrowed these projects and data sets from UCI machine learning group (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). 
Based on my experience in software engineering and architecture, many of the intelligent services are data-driven and a computer scientist and engineer should always refresh and review fundamentals in machine learning, statistics and optimization.
